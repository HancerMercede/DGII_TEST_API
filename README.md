#  THIS IS THE BACK-END PROJECT FOR THE DGII TEST API

To execute the api run the migrations to persist the information into the db, before execute them check if you are in the persistence project becuase this is the main layer to work with entity framework core.

This project was built with .NET 7, using Ef core 7 and others tools.
